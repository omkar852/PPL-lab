1.] Here bb3 and bb4 corresponds to the whileloop. bb4 is the while conditional.
	In case of if-else statements after the evaluation of statements in if block, there is an unconditional goto. But for a "while loop" threre is no unconditional goto after the expression in if statement i.e. the statement is evaluated until becomes false.


2.] bb5 : Outer loop initialise
bb6 : Inner loop initialise
bb10 : Outer loop conditional
bb8 : inner loop conditional
bb7 : inner loop body and variable increement
bb9 : Outer loop variable increement
	In case of "for loop", always there is a need of an iterator which has to be modified after each execution. And the loop terminates when this iterator reaches its limit. 
	But for "while loop", iterator even may not be used. It just keeps on checking the given statement until it becomes false.
